        "# Modular AI Agent Demo – LangChain + Groq + Tools\n",
        "\n",
        "##  What This Notebook Demonstrates\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook is a **minimal but functional demonstration of Modular AI Agents**, as discussed in the article _“How Modular AI Agents Work”_. It shows how a large language model (LLM) can be used not just to generate text, but to **intelligently orchestrate tasks** across multiple tools — like a smart project manager assigning jobs to specialists.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "##  Why This Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "In modern AI applications, it's not enough for a model to just answer questions. We want agents that can:\n",
        "- Break down complex prompts into smaller tasks\n",
        "- Choose the right tool for each task (e.g., a calculator or a search engine)\n",
        "- Combine the results to respond intelligently\n",
        "\n",
        "This type of orchestration is the core idea behind **Modular AI Agents**.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## How It Works in This Notebook\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **The User Prompt**:  \n",
        "   The user gives a compound query like:  \n",
        "   `\"Summarize who Marie Curie was and also compute 20 * 4\"`\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **The Agent**:  \n",
        "   The LLM (Groq’s LLaMA3 in this case) receives this prompt and decides:\n",
        "   - That “who Marie Curie was” requires a search → it uses the **Wikipedia tool**\n",
        "   - That “compute 20 * 4” requires math → it uses the **Calculator tool**\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **The Tools**:  \n",
        "   - The **WikipediaAPIWrapper** fetches factual info from Wikipedia\n",
        "   - A **custom Calculator function** evaluates basic math expressions\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **The Orchestration**:  \n",
        "   The agent invokes the tools in the right order, based on task type.  \n",
        "   This is done using LangChain’s `initialize_agent()` function and `ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION` agent type.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## What This Shows\n",
        "\n",
        "This code proves — in a very small but clear way — how modular agents work:\n",
        "- They are **task-aware**\n",
        "- They use **tools like plugins**\n",
        "- They **don’t hardcode logic**; the LLM dynamically plans and routes each query\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Tools & Libraries Used\n",
        "\n",
        "- **LangChain** – for agent creation and tool abstraction  \n",
        "- **Groq LLaMA3** – as the language model (fast inference)  \n",
        "- **Wikipedia API** – as a fact retrieval tool  \n",
        "- **Custom Calculator** – a simple math parser (using `eval()`)\n",

With 3.7 million inhabitants, it has the highest population within its city limits of any city in the European Union. The city is also one of the states of Germany, being the third smallest state in the country by area. Berlin is surrounded by the state of Brandenburg, and Brandenburg's capital Potsdam is nearby. The urban area of Berlin has a population of over 4.6 million and is therefore the most populous urban area in Germany. The Berlin-Brandenburg capital region has around 6.2 million inhabitants and is Germany's second-largest metropolitan region after the Rhine-Ruhr region, as well as the fifth-biggest metropolitan region by GDP in the European Union.\n",
            "Berlin was built along the banks of the Spree river, which flows into the Havel in the western borough of Spandau. The city includes lakes in the western and southeastern boroughs, the largest of which is Müggelsee. About one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks and gardens, rivers, canals, and lakes.\n",
            "First documented in the 13th century and at the crossing of two important historic trade routes, Berlin was designated the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg (1417–1701), Kingdom of Prussia (1701–1918), German Empire (1871–1918), Weimar Republic (1919–1933), and Nazi Germany (1933–1945). Berlin served as a scientific, artistic, and philosophical hub during the Age of Enlightenment, Neoclassicism, and the German revolutions of 1848–1849. During the Gründerzeit, an industrialization-induced economic boom triggered a rapid population increase in Berlin. 1920s Berlin was the third-largest city in the world by population. After World War II and following Berlin's occupation, the city was split into West Berlin and East Berlin, divided by the Berlin Wall. East Berlin was declared the capital of East Germany, while Bonn became the West German capital. Following German reunification in 1990, Berlin once again became the capital of all of Germany. Due to its geographic location and history, Berlin has been called \"the heart of Europe\".\n",
            "Berlin is a global city of culture, politics, media and science. Its economy is based on high tech and the service sector, encompassing a diverse range of creative industries, startup companies, research facilities, and media corporations. Berlin serves as a continental hub for air and rail traffic and has a complex public transportation network. Tourism in Berlin makes the city a popular global destination. Significant industries include information technology, the healthcare industry, biomedical engineering, biotechnology, the automotive industry, and electronics.\n",
            "Berlin is home to several universities, such as the Humboldt University of Berlin, Technische Universität Berlin, the Berlin University of the Arts and the Free University of Berlin. The Berlin Zoological Garden is the most visited zoo in Europe. Babelsberg Studio is the world's first large-scale movie studio complex, and there are many films set in Berlin. Berlin is home to three World Heritage Sites: Museum Island, the Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin, and the Berlin Modernism Housing Estates. Other landmarks include the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag building, Potsdamer Platz, the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, and the Berlin Wall Memorial.

Her husband, Pierre Curie, was a co-winner of her first Nobel Prize, making them the first married couple to win the Nobel Prize and launching the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. She was, in 1906, the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.\n",
            "She was born in Warsaw, in what was then the Kingdom of Poland, part of the Russian Empire. She studied at Warsaw's clandestine Flying University and began her practical scientific training in Warsaw. In 1891, aged 24, she followed her elder sister Bronisława to study in Paris, where she earned her higher degrees and conducted her subsequent scientific work. In 1895, she married the French physicist Pierre Curie, and she shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with him and with the physicist Henri Becquerel for their pioneering work developing the theory of \"radioactivity\"—a term she coined. In 1906, Pierre Curie died in a Paris street accident. Marie won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery of the elements polonium and radium, using techniques she invented for isolating radioactive isotopes. \n",
            "Under her direction, the world's first studies were conducted into the treatment of neoplasms by the use of radioactive isotopes. She founded the Curie Institute in Paris in 1920, and the Curie Institute in Warsaw in 1932; both remain major medical research centres. During World War I, she developed mobile radiography units to provide X-ray services to field hospitals.\n",
            "While a French citizen, Marie Skłodowska Curie, who used both surnames, never lost her sense of Polish identity. She taught her daughters the Polish language and took them on visits to Poland. She named the first chemical element she discovered polonium, after her native country. \n",
            "Marie Curie died in 1934, aged 66, at the Sancellemoz sanatorium in Passy (Haute-Savoie), France, of aplastic anaemia likely from exposure to radiation in the course of her scientific research and in the course of her radiological work at field hospitals during World War I. In addition to her Nobel Prizes, she received numerous other honours and tributes; in 1995 she became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the Paris Panthéon, and Poland declared 2011 the Year of Marie Curie during the International Year of Chemistry.
